## About

**Bingo Board** is a goal-tracking bingo game that runs entirely in the browser. You define a pool of goals (or use sample goals), generate a random board, and mark tiles as you complete them. Win by completing 1 or more Bingos, or go for a full blackout. The game includes a built-in music player, strikes (edit/skip/replace tiles), pause/resume, and the ability to save cards and download your board as an image after a win.

No server or database required — everything is stored in the browser (localStorage).

## Features

- **Goal pool** — Add your own goals (one per line) or use sample goals. Save and load goal pools.
- **Customizable board** — Board size (3×3, 4×4, 5×5), win condition (1–5 Bingos or Blackout), optional center “Free” space.
- **Strikes** — Long-press a tile to use a strike: edit the goal, skip it (counts as marked), or replace with a random goal from your pool. Three strikes per game.
- **Pause & resume** — Pause the timer; no moves allowed until you resume. Clear pause banner when paused.
- **Scoring** — +10 per mark, −8 per unmark, +75 per Bingo line.
- **Save Card** — Save your current board with a name and view saved cards from the home screen.
- **Download Card** — After a win, download an image of your board (filename: `Bingo Board - YYYY-MM-DD.png`).
- **Music player** — Built-in player: play tracks from the `music/` folder, upload MP3s, or add YouTube links. Background music option.
- **Responsive design** — Works on desktop and mobile. No build step.
